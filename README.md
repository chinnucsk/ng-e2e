Angular E2E Example
===================

This is an example project that shows how to get end-to-end tests up
and running with Angular, Karma and Grunt.

Running the tests
-----------------

Right now it is necessary to start the Grunt server first and then run
the tests:

    grunt server
    grunt test # Do this in another terminal
